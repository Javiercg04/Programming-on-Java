Streams, files, folders and archives 
(ENGLISH Version) 
1. Create class FunctionClass, with functionality:

 Merge content of all three text files in new file 
 Archive 4 files: the new one and 3 original files. 
Main tasks (HW-files):  
2. Create class SplitFile.java, with functionality: 
 If you pass as argument text file and number (size in bytes) – it gets file 
content and splits it into chunks with size – equals to size in bytes 
argument, for example: 
 SplitJava demo.txt 1024 -> splits file demo.txt for example if 
demo.txt is 2049 bytes- then results is: 
 demo_PART001.txt (from  0 to 1023 byte), 
demo_PART002.txt (1024 to 2048 byte) and 
demo_PART003.txt – contains last 2048 bytes. 
 Make the same, but for binary file (SplitBinaryFile.java). Is there 
any difference? 
3. Create class FileMerge.java – which merges files, from task 2..
